Team: Cleaning crew

	The cleaning crew has a very straight forward idea in creating an app that assists with the tasks of the physical plant by 
creating a possibly better system than the paper house keeping logs that are currently used. They also wish to automate many 
processes such as time away from work requests and create a better communication method between people of the workplace. 
Personally as a crew lead of the cleaning crew in the fieldhouse I really like this idea and would like to see how it comes 
together. I think this is a unique idea that is deserving of some attention and could be useful if implemented properly. 

	From my perusing of their code on github they so far seem to have only a little bit of code and not quite worked much 
towards coding yet.
