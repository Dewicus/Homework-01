Does their Trello board show the appropriate amount of activity?

Their Trello board looks to show a decent amount of activity by the members.

Write a one-to-two-paragraph review of their models. Are their user stories, class model and UI model well-formulated? Do they describe a coherent system?

I was able to find their user stories on Trello and they seemed to be fairly sound overall and well formatted. Their domain model was well formatted and 
seemed to go over everything. Their UI model overall looks easy enough to move through also and seems sound also. Overall I have no real complaints on the 
system besides maybe repositioning the time off requests.

Has there been an appropriate amount of code pushed into their client repo? Can you run the prototype? If so, does the application make sense to you?
Does their supplemental specification address non-functional requirements? Are they missing anything important?

It seems they have pushed a decent amount of code that does have a settings menu implemented.
